            <p> Hello <abbr title="Robert">Rob</abbr>. My name is Vince Espinoza and I am 20 years old. 
    I was born in the Philippines and moved to Canada about 13 years ago. 
    Some of my hobbies that I enjoy are: travelling, hiking, playing games on my free time, 
    playing sports such as; skiing, badminton. Example for superscipt: (E=mc<sup>2</sup>)?
            </p>
    <br>

<p>The reason I took this program; Interactive Media Design is for my love for technology. 
    I have a background in Media Arts and a bit of coding Java, back in high school. 
    Although the main reason to taking this program is to pursue my interest for film.
</p>

    <br>

<p>I guess a motivational quote that I follow is that 
    <em>“ Take care of yourself before others”</em>. I'm not too sure to whom this is quoted to.
</p>

    <br>

<p> As I listed my hobbies on the first paragraph, here they are again:</p>
